# Python Dictionaries: Medical Insurance Project

## Overview
The Medical Insurance Project aims to demonstrate proficiency in Python programming by efficiently organizing and updating medical records. This project utilizes Python dictionaries to create a database of medical records for patients.

## Project Goals
- **Data Storage**: Organize patient names and insurance costs efficiently.
- **Data Processing**: Update and manipulate medical data effectively.
- **Database Management**: Create and maintain a dictionary-based medical records database.
- **Data Access**: Retrieve and display specific medical information as needed.

## Prerequisites
Completion of the Basics of Python and Dictionaries sections of a Python programming course or equivalent knowledge is recommended before attempting this project.

## Project Requirements
1. **Storing Patient Names and Insurance Costs**:
   - Create an empty dictionary called `medical_costs`.
   - Add initial patient data to `medical_costs` and update it accordingly.
   - Calculate and print the average insurance cost.

2. **List Comprehension to Dictionary**:
   - Create a dictionary mapping patient names to their ages using list comprehension.
   - Retrieve and print Marina's age using the `.get()` method.

3. **Using a Dictionary to Create a Medical Database**:
   - Create a dictionary `medical_records` representing a database of medical records.
   - Populate `medical_records` with data for multiple patients.
   - Print specific medical information for individual patients.
   - Remove a patient from `medical_records` if necessary.
   - Iterate through `medical_records` to print detailed medical records for each patient.

## Extra
Congratulations on completing the project! For further practice and enhancement:
- Implement a function `update_medical_records()` to update medical records dynamically.
- Explore additional features to add to the medical records database.
