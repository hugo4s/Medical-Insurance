# Hurricane Analysis Project

## Overview
The Hurricane Analysis project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, particularly in handling data related to Category 5 Hurricanes. This project involves writing functions to organize and manipulate hurricane data, showcasing skills in parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.

## Project Goals
- Data Processing: Update and process data on hurricane damages.
- Data Organization: Construct dictionaries containing attributes of hurricanes and organize hurricanes by year.
- Data Analysis: Analyze the impact of hurricanes by counting affected areas, identifying the most affected area, and determining the deadliest hurricane.
- Rating Hurricanes: Rate hurricanes based on mortality and damage scales, and categorize them accordingly.

## Prerequisites
Completion of the Loops and Dictionaries sections of the Learn Python 3 Course or equivalent knowledge is recommended before attempting this project.

## Project Requirements
1. Update Recorded Damages: Write a function to update the recorded damages of hurricanes.
2. Create a Table: Construct a dictionary containing various attributes of hurricanes.
3. Organizing by Year: Convert the dictionary of hurricanes into a new dictionary organized by year.
4. Counting Damaged Areas: Count how often each area is listed as an affected area of a hurricane.
5. Calculating Maximum Hurricane Count: Find the area affected by the most hurricanes and how often it was hit.
6. Calculating the Deadliest Hurricane: Identify the hurricane that caused the greatest number of deaths and the death toll.
7. Rating Hurricanes by Mortality: Rate hurricanes based on a mortality scale and categorize them accordingly.
8. Calculating Hurricane Maximum Damage: Determine the hurricane that caused the greatest damage and its cost.
9. Rating Hurricanes by Damage: Rate hurricanes based on a damage scale and categorize them accordingly.
